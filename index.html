        Peter Griffin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane">(Seth MacFarlane)</a>is the central character of
        "Family Guy." He and his family live in Quahog, Rhode
        Island. Speaking with a thick New England accent, he operates as if he is smarter than everyone else, but in reality,
        he's clueless. He spends his free time drinking at the Drunken Clam with his buddies, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe.
        Peter has worked for various companies, including the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery and the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory (no
        doubt modeled after Hasbro, which is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island). Also, Peter has a long history of
        fighting with a giant yellow chicken.</p>

        <p>
            Lois Griffin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Borstein">(Alex Borstein)</a> is Peter's wife. She comes
            from the wealthy Pewterschmidt family and married
            Peter against their wishes. Lois is an accomplished piano player and singer. She's considered to be very attractive,
            which is proven by Quagmire's not-so-subtle advances toward her as well as her short-lived career as a model ("Model
            Misbehavior"). She may be more sophisticated than Peter, but we have seen occasionally that she shares his low-brow
            humor and lustfulness.

        <p>
            Meg Griffin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mila_Kunis">(Mila Kunis)</a> is the only daughter of Peter and
            Lois. She is frequently the butt of the
            family's jokes and is considered to be unattractive and a loser. She and Peter did bond when his driver's license
            was
            revoked and she chauffeured him around town. Her chance to shine as a star came in "Don't Make Me Over." Also, she
            has a
            crush on Luke Perry.

        <p>
            Chris Griffin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Green">(Seth Green)</a> is Peter and Lois' eldest son.
            He's not terribly bright, but he is a talented artist ("The
            Son Also Draws") and rock singer ("Saving Private Brian"). He admires his father and follows blindly into many of
            Peter's misadventures. Also, he fears the crazy monkey in his closet.

        <p>Stewie Griffin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane">(Seth MacFarlane)</a> may be a baby, but he is
            as diabolical as the worst villain. He is highly intelligent,
            but he's still very attached to his teddy bear, Rupert. He has schemed many times to destroy Lois but has failed at
            every attempt. In early seasons, it was insinuated that Stewie is homosexual. In recent seasons, the writers have
            become
            more obvious with his sexual leanings, though the humor is usually couched in Stewie's complete ignorance of his own
            comments.

        <td><h2>Brian Griffin</h2>
        <p>Brian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane">(Seth MacFarlane)</a> is the Griffin family's dog. He
            seems to be the wisest and most sensible of all the characters,
            regardless of the fact that he still urinates on the carpet in Lois' presence. Yes, that's right, he is in love with
            Lois.
            He and Stewie are usually pitted against each other or drawn together by extreme circumstances, such as a road trip
            to
            find Brian's mother (the former) or recruitment into the military (the latter). They can often be found singing
            duets
            together. Brian has had a girlfriend, Jillian, and enjoys the occasional martini.
